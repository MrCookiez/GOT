### API
* https://anapioficeandfire.com/ (main data)
* https://agify.io (age by name data)

### Installation

> Run yarn or npm install

### Description
* Pagination limit 10 characters per page
* Filtering on different columns (Applies on all table fields)
* Sort ordering on different columns
(Note: The API a lot of information so the filtering/ordering makes mostly sense on name and age)

* In order to minimize the request the application uses ContextAPI to store the unique requests
* The application uses a second API in order to add age to the characters
* The application uses twitter bootstrap as a css library
